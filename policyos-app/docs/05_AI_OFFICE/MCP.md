# MCP Integration

MCP servers may expose approved tools and data sources to agents.

## Requirements
- explicit server allowlist
- tool-level permissions
- organization-scoped credentials
- input and output validation
- timeout and retry policy
- audit logging
- human approval for consequential write actions

MCP is an integration boundary, not a trust boundary.

## Sprint 6 Checkpoint 6: Governed MCP gateway

MCP is an untrusted integration boundary governed by explicit server and tool allowlists. Five disabled-by-configuration connector definitions cover law, minutes, finance, internal documents, and public data. Fake clients are the test default; remote networking and local process execution require explicit opt-in and are not implemented as implicit fallbacks.

Every call validates active membership, RBAC permission, organization scope, classification, read/write consequences, human approval, JSON schemas, paths, URLs, result size, and suspicious prompt/script markers. Restricted data cannot leave PolicyOS; confidential external transmission needs organization policy. Cancellation propagates, retries are bounded to transient failures, and stale cache usage is disclosed.

Audit records contain identifiers, policy decisions, timing, retry/result counts and status only—never arguments, results, credentials, tokens, or document text. Cache keys are organization/classification scoped and hash normalized parameters. Connector outputs become untrusted `EvidenceCandidate` records with provenance and incomplete-citation warnings. Real national law, meeting, budget MCP connections, distributed cache, and management/execution HTTP APIs remain follow-up work.

## Sprint 6 Checkpoint 7: Governed knowledge routing

The Knowledge Router uses deterministic rules—not an LLM planner—to classify policy, legal, ordinance, minutes, budget, statistics, internal-document, speech, press, combined, and unknown queries. Its route matrix selects organization-scoped Hybrid RAG and allowlisted MCP connectors, runs independent sources concurrently within one timeout budget, preserves partial results, and records denied or failed sources instead of reporting false success.

Evidence is normalized into one contract, deduplicated by stable external/citation/content identity, capped per source/document, and ranked with retrieval relevance, official-source category, citation completeness, freshness and stable identifiers. Different institutions remain distinct. Legal effective-date and budget fiscal-year conflicts are surfaced without silently choosing a winner. Type-specific gaps lower confidence and material/critical gaps require human review.

Fallback provenance, stale warnings, source failures, permissions and review requirements remain visible. Restricted data cannot use external routes, and MCP receives only connector-specific parameters and opaque request metadata. Router audit stores query hashes, selected/executed/denied sources, counts, status, confidence and latency—never query text, evidence text, credentials, raw MCP results or reasoning. Real connector wiring and `/api/v1/knowledge/query` remain follow-up application-container work.
