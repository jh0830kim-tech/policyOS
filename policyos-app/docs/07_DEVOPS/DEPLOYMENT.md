# Deployment

Environments:
- local
- test
- staging
- production

Each environment must have separate credentials and databases. Production deployment requires migration review, rollback plan, health verification, and release notes.
## AI provider release and rollback

Sprint 5 deployments must apply Alembic through revision `20260720_0006`, validate the network-free smoke suite, and enable OpenAI only after privacy and secret-management approval. During rollback, first switch `AI_PROVIDER=disabled`, drain in-flight work, roll back application instances, and downgrade additive migrations only when operationally necessary and after metadata archival. The full checklist and incident procedures are in `RELEASE_NOTES_v0.3.md` and `RUNBOOK.md`.

## Sprint 6 Checkpoint 6: Governed MCP gateway

MCP is an untrusted integration boundary governed by explicit server and tool allowlists. Five disabled-by-configuration connector definitions cover law, minutes, finance, internal documents, and public data. Fake clients are the test default; remote networking and local process execution require explicit opt-in and are not implemented as implicit fallbacks.

Every call validates active membership, RBAC permission, organization scope, classification, read/write consequences, human approval, JSON schemas, paths, URLs, result size, and suspicious prompt/script markers. Restricted data cannot leave PolicyOS; confidential external transmission needs organization policy. Cancellation propagates, retries are bounded to transient failures, and stale cache usage is disclosed.

Audit records contain identifiers, policy decisions, timing, retry/result counts and status only—never arguments, results, credentials, tokens, or document text. Cache keys are organization/classification scoped and hash normalized parameters. Connector outputs become untrusted `EvidenceCandidate` records with provenance and incomplete-citation warnings. Real national law, meeting, budget MCP connections, distributed cache, and management/execution HTTP APIs remain follow-up work.

## Sprint 6 Checkpoint 9: Knowledge security governance

Knowledge operations are authorized at request/query time using organization, active membership, permission, source policy, revocation state, classification, purpose, and approval context. Public/internal are ordinarily eligible; confidential requires explicit organization authorization; restricted evidence is never sent to external providers or MCP and excerpts are length-limited. Child chunks, citations, embeddings, and derived artifacts must retain at least the parent's classification. Classification downgrade requires administrative review, approval, and a clear DLP scan.

Uploaded documents, retrieved evidence, and MCP results are untrusted data, never system instructions. Deterministic prompt-injection and DLP scanners record only categories, severity, and counts. High/critical findings are excluded from agent context or force review. Regex heuristics can produce false positives (for example, phone/account patterns overlap) and require human review; raw matches, prompts, documents, MCP output, credentials, and hidden reasoning are never audited.

Unified audit events are append-only and organization-scoped, with event/time, task/package, and source/document indexes. Legal holds block cleanup and purge. Retention begins in dry-run mode, preserves current versions and approved artifacts, and deletes embeddings before parent chunks. Physical purge requires approval. Reclassification invalidates retrieval/embedding caches; membership, role, source-policy, document, or organization-policy changes are enforced on the next request. Immediate termination of already-running distributed sessions remains an operational follow-up.

Operational permissions: `knowledge.read` covers read/search; `knowledge.manage` covers ingest/embed/archive/source management; `knowledge.reclassify` plus approval covers downgrade; `knowledge.delete` plus approval covers purge; `knowledge.export` plus approval covers export; `mcp.execute` covers governed tools; `audit.read` is required for organization audit queries. Cross-organization access and quota pooling are prohibited. Rate limits are scoped by organization, user, and action and expose only safe retry-after metadata. Incident sinks are pluggable and disabled by default; no SIEM, chat, or email call is made by the built-in fake/disabled sinks.
## Sprint 6 v0.4 release candidate

The governed Knowledge Platform release candidate is covered by a synthetic, network-free E2E flow from login and organization RBAC through combined internal RAG/fake MCP routing, cited evidence merge, conflict/gap and confidence assessment, eight-agent Chief Secretary orchestration, reviewable Work Package/artifact persistence, and safe API output. All fixture facts are explicitly fictional. Default CI forbids real OpenAI, remote MCP, and subprocess MCP calls.

Release operation requires Alembic head `20260720_0013`, reviewed environment settings, backup/rollback, retention dry-run, legal-hold protection, privacy incident handling, and provider/MCP outage procedures. See `RELEASE_NOTES_v0.4.md` and `RUNBOOK.md`. Production pgvector/ANN, real government connectors, workers, Redis coordination, scheduled cleanup, SIEM integrations, and live staging verification remain deferred.
