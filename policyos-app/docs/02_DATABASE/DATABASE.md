# Database Strategy

## Primary database
PostgreSQL is the system of record.

## ORM
SQLAlchemy 2.x async.

## Migration
Alembic migrations are required for schema changes.

## Conventions
- Primary keys: UUID preferred for externally exposed entities.
- Timestamps: UTC, timezone-aware.
- Soft deletion: use only where audit or recovery requirements justify it.
- Organization scope: explicit foreign key for organization-owned records.
- Sensitive fields: classify and protect according to security policy.

## Transaction rule
A business operation that must succeed or fail as a unit must run within one explicit transaction boundary.
## AI execution records
ai_tasks and agent_runs store ownership, status, review state, lineage, prompt/model metadata, timestamps, safe errors, and concise result or artifact references. Raw instructions, secrets, provider payloads, and hidden reasoning are excluded.
## Secure knowledge ingestion persistence

Ingestion creates an organization-scoped job before scanning and parsing. Job states are `pending`, `scanning`, `parsing`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `duplicate`, and `rejected`. Parsed normalized text is stored on the immutable document version; original file bytes are not stored. File and parser metadata, SHA-256, scan metadata, source lineage, classification, and optional official-document dates remain JSON metadata. Revision `20260720_0008` adds parsed content, ingestion states, and `knowledge.ingest`/`knowledge.read` permission seeds.
## Deterministic chunk sets and citations

Revision `20260720_0009` adds versioned chunk-set metadata and structured citation locators. A chunk set is identified by document version, chunking strategy/config hash, and organization. Unique constraints prevent duplicate indices and hashes within the same set. Changing configuration creates a new set without deleting prior chunks; the document version records the active config hash and `pending/running/succeeded/failed` chunking status. Citations retain source/document/version/chunk composite tenant lineage, page and section locators, heading, external source ID, content hash, and completeness metadata.

## Sprint 6 Checkpoint 4: Embedding and vector retrieval

- Embeddings use a provider-independent gateway (`fake`, `disabled`, or explicitly configured `openai`).
- Model, dimension, chunking configuration, normalization strategy, provider, and policy version participate in immutable embedding revisions.
- The default fake provider is SHA-256 deterministic and performs no network I/O. OpenAI uses bounded application retries while SDK retries are disabled.
- External embedding follows provider transmission policy: restricted content is blocked and confidential content requires organization policy. Embedding records never duplicate source text or secrets.
- Current persistence stores validated vectors as JSON for PostgreSQL/SQLite compatibility. `VectorStore` isolates this detail; production pgvector indexing is planned and must fail clearly if the extension is unavailable.
- Retrieval enforces organization, model, dimension, classification, document/source, effective-date, top-k, and minimum-score filters. Cosine scores remain in the native [-1, 1] range.
- Usage records capture input count/tokens, batch/retry count, latency, provider request ID and nullable estimated cost; pricing is not hard-coded.
- Public embedding/search HTTP endpoints are deferred; application services are the authorization-ready boundary.

## Sprint 6 Checkpoint 5: Hybrid retrieval and reranking

Hybrid retrieval normalizes Unicode with NFKC, preserves quoted phrases, removes forbidden controls, and uses a conservative Korean-aware tokenizer. The tokenizer only strips a small configured suffix set; it does not invent synonyms, and a future morphological adapter can replace it.

Lexical retrieval uses deterministic BM25-like term-frequency/IDF scoring with phrase, title, heading, and section boosts. Vector candidates reuse the provider-independent vector boundary, while production PostgreSQL full-text search remains behind an adapter protocol. Weighted max-normalized lexical scores and cosine-normalized vector scores are combined with reciprocal-rank fusion; stable chunk IDs break ties.

Deterministic reranking exposes authority, freshness, citation, and duplicate adjustments without hidden reasoning. Authority categories are configurable and never replace relevance. Exact duplicates within one source are collapsed, neighboring document results receive a penalty, and per-document/source caps preserve diversity. Evidence is sufficient, partial, or insufficient based on score, citation quality, official-source presence, freshness, and question-specific legal/budget needs.

Search telemetry stores a salted organization-scoped query hash, counts, filters, latency, provider/model, reranker, warnings, and evidence status. It never stores query or result text. Public `/knowledge/search/hybrid` routing is deferred until the application container can inject organization-scoped lexical/vector repositories; the service already enforces permissions and safe bounded contracts.

## Sprint 6 Checkpoint 6: Governed MCP gateway

MCP is an untrusted integration boundary governed by explicit server and tool allowlists. Five disabled-by-configuration connector definitions cover law, minutes, finance, internal documents, and public data. Fake clients are the test default; remote networking and local process execution require explicit opt-in and are not implemented as implicit fallbacks.

Every call validates active membership, RBAC permission, organization scope, classification, read/write consequences, human approval, JSON schemas, paths, URLs, result size, and suspicious prompt/script markers. Restricted data cannot leave PolicyOS; confidential external transmission needs organization policy. Cancellation propagates, retries are bounded to transient failures, and stale cache usage is disclosed.

Audit records contain identifiers, policy decisions, timing, retry/result counts and status only—never arguments, results, credentials, tokens, or document text. Cache keys are organization/classification scoped and hash normalized parameters. Connector outputs become untrusted `EvidenceCandidate` records with provenance and incomplete-citation warnings. Real national law, meeting, budget MCP connections, distributed cache, and management/execution HTTP APIs remain follow-up work.

## Sprint 6 Checkpoint 7: Governed knowledge routing

The Knowledge Router uses deterministic rules—not an LLM planner—to classify policy, legal, ordinance, minutes, budget, statistics, internal-document, speech, press, combined, and unknown queries. Its route matrix selects organization-scoped Hybrid RAG and allowlisted MCP connectors, runs independent sources concurrently within one timeout budget, preserves partial results, and records denied or failed sources instead of reporting false success.

Evidence is normalized into one contract, deduplicated by stable external/citation/content identity, capped per source/document, and ranked with retrieval relevance, official-source category, citation completeness, freshness and stable identifiers. Different institutions remain distinct. Legal effective-date and budget fiscal-year conflicts are surfaced without silently choosing a winner. Type-specific gaps lower confidence and material/critical gaps require human review.

Fallback provenance, stale warnings, source failures, permissions and review requirements remain visible. Restricted data cannot use external routes, and MCP receives only connector-specific parameters and opaque request metadata. Router audit stores query hashes, selected/executed/denied sources, counts, status, confidence and latency—never query text, evidence text, credentials, raw MCP results or reasoning. Real connector wiring and `/api/v1/knowledge/query` remain follow-up application-container work.

## Sprint 6 Checkpoint 8: Evidence-aware AI Office

The production Office application service can receive an injected governed Knowledge Router before specialist execution. It builds one organization-scoped query, rejects wholly unavailable evidence, converts the router result to a minimized `OfficeEvidencePackage`, and stores only query/route identifiers plus counts, confidence, sufficiency, failures, and fallback status on the Work Package.

`AgentContext` carries the optional package. The Chief Secretary workflow deterministically selects legal evidence for Legal Review, budget evidence for Budget Analysis, statistical evidence for Statistics, and approved cited facts for public-facing agents. Safe excerpts, classifications, stable evidence IDs and existing citation IDs propagate through AgentResult and artifact structured payloads; agents cannot create substitute citations. All approved prompt files instruct agents to use supplied evidence only and expose conflicts, gaps, stale sources and unsupported claims.

Partial/insufficient evidence, material gaps, unresolved conflicts, incomplete or stale citations, public-facing artifacts, unsupported claims, or partial Agent failures require review. Approval is never automatic. Evidence-unavailable execution stops before provider calls. Existing timeout, cancellation, privacy, provider telemetry and artifact review controls remain authoritative. API request schemas accept legal/budget/minutes workflows and source/date/fiscal context; production router/executor composition in the HTTP dependency container remains follow-up work.
